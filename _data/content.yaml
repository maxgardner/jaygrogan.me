  For 10 years, fitness has been an essential part of my life. When I first started training, my only goal was to achieve a good aesthetic. As I learned more, I realized a healthy lifestyle is so much bigger than how you look. It’s how you feel. It’s having the energy to take on the day. It’s a good night’s sleep. It’s a strong metabolism. It’s getting a good bill of health from the doctor. My goal is to help you not only achieve your physical goals but facilitate an overall healthy lifestyle you can manage and maintain.
dj: |
  Music has always been my biggest passion. I started producing original tracks in high school and worked as a DJ through college. Now, when I walk into brunch, a party, or wedding reception, it feels like I’m always asking myself, what’s the vibe of the room? I pride myself in staying current but also keep an arsenal of throwbacks for every decade. One thing that separates me from the average DJ is I’ll actually play what you ask for — not a remix you’ve never heard of. My favorite genres are Pop, R&B, Hip-Hop, and House.
modeling: |
  Fashion holds a special place in my heart. I regularly find myself in a Barnes and Noble flipping through the latest issue of Vogue, Elle, and Harper’s Bazaar Magazine, curious what direction the industry is headed. I then go on a hunt for similar pieces to recreate the look. After watching a runway show during New York Fashion week, I felt inspired to start modeling. Shortly after, I began studying poses and did my first photo shoot. It would be an absolute dream to walk a runway someday and model for an athleisure or streetwear brand.
